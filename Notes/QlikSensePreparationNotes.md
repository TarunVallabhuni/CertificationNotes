## Topics

### Business Analyst

#### 1. Identify Requirements
1. Based on business requirements, identify Qlik products, needed for the solution (QSE,
QDC, QABDI, ODAG, Qlik Core, Attunity, Insight Bot, NPrinting, etc.)
2. Explain Qlik Sense features (e.g., smart search, responsive design, accessibility
features, themes, etc.) and how they impact app design
3. Describe the differences between the Qlik deployment options
4. Based on business requirements, identify KPIs, dimensions and measures,
5. Ask appropriate questions to understand the needs of the potential users of the Qlik
Sense application
6. Identify user types and their typical devices to use to access apps
7. Explain the purpose of APIs, server-side extensions (such as R, Python), Qlik
GeoAnalytics, web mashups, widgets, section access
8. Explain and interpret results from Qlik Associative Engine
9. Identify Qlik Cognitive Engine uses
10. Consider performance during data loading and application development (removing
unused columns, consider calculation condition)
#### 2. Prepare and Load Data
1. Create a basic data model using Data Manager (e.g., spreadsheets, CSV, flat files,
QVDs, etc.)
2. Define the steps to load and associate data
3. Apply filters while loading data in Data Manager
4. Manually create data table in Data Manager (creates Inline Load script)
5. Explain synthetic keys and possible methods of resolution
6. Create folder and file data connections
7. Leverage data connections already in Qlik Sense Enterprise
#### 3. Design Applications
1. Based on the business requirements and desired insight, determine the optimal
number of charts, correct chart type, order of dimensions, use of color, and measures
2. Design the order of the sheets in an application to provide an overall flow matching
the expectations of the user journey (DAR concept)
3. Select object types appropriate for the required data analysis (e.g., a line chart to
show a trend over time)
4. Understand when and why to use an alternate chart recommendation
5. Identify the proper expression to create the appropriate visualization to meet the
business requirements
6. Explain the impact of using mobiles devices on app design
7. Leverage appropriate method for data comparisons (filters, bookmarks, alternate
states, set analysis)
Page 5
8. Distinguish between situations when data security requirements need to use section
access or security rules
#### 4. Develop Applications
1. Add dimensions, measures, and objects
2. Use the latest objects and features in the Visualization Bundle, e.g., trellis chart, Profit
& Loss pivot table
3. Use Advanced Authoring features, e.g., specify a default landing sheet, native
container object, etc.
4. Set up visualizations with alternate states
5. Change the grid size after adding objects
6. Create and use variables
7. Use custom color in charts (e.g., ColorMix, CSS colors, If statements, etc.)
8. Know what extensions are and when to use them
9. Create a story
10. Create master items
11. Apply filters and create bookmarks
12. Use advanced functions like AGGR and set analysis
13. Perform tasks around making a production ready application (e.g., create a thumbnail
image, appropriate title, etc.)
14. Use Insight Advisor to generate visualizations
15. Use chart suggestions to change visualization type
16. Select appropriate screen layout


### Data Architect

#### 1. Identify Requirements for Data Models
1. Given a set of business objectives, determine KPIs, dimensions or measures
2. Given customer requirements, determine an appropriate solution to meet the
customer needs (e.g., data, variables, master items, GeoAnalytics, advanced analytics
integration)
3. Interpret app security requirements
#### 2. Design Data Models
1. Given a data set, identify quality issues and potential solutions
2. Determine the expected effects of data quality issues
3. Given a data set, determine the relationships among data and how the relationships
will affect the Qlik Sense data model (e.g., performance, accuracy, scalability)
4. Use various methods and explain considerations for connecting to different types of
data sources
#### 3. Build Data Models
1. Describe the circumstances under which different load strategies should be used
(including On-Demand App Generation (ODAG), incremental load
2. Explain load techniques and functions relevant to data transformation and filtering
3. Understand the data profiling capabilities in Data Manager (e.g., sorting, bucketing,
splitting)
4. Understand the differences between Data Load Editor and Data Manager and how and
when to use each or both for loading data
5. Given a scenario, determine how to resolve table association issues (e.g., synthetic
keys, circular references)
6. Explain the circumstances under which QVD and QVX files and/or n-tiered data
architectures should be recommended
7. Describe the use and properties of fact tables and dimension tables
8. Explain how to resolve complex calendar scenarios
