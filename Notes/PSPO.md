## Strategy for passing the PSPO I certification

- Book the exam ahead in time. This means your study time is time-boxed and you have a deadline to work towards. One month should be more than enough. 
- Read the official Scrum Guide. Read it again. Keep on reading till you get bored. It is only ~ 20 pages!
- Make a Mind Map. Formalise what you have read in a mental model. This will aid remembering and reinforce learning.
- Do all the open assessments available on Scrum.org for each role: Development Team, Scrum Master and Product Owner. Keep doing this until you consistently score 100 procent. If you fail a question, read the relevant parts in the Scrum guide. Doing all available open assessments helps to understand where each role starts and ends.
- The devil is in the details. Make sure you are able to answer the following questions by heart:
  - When does a sprint start? When does it finish?
  - When is it okay to cancel a sprint?
  - What are all Scrum Events and which artefacts do they produce?
  - What are the minimum and maximum time-boxes for each Scrum Event? If applicable, what do the time-boxes depend on?
  - Who needs to be present at each Scrum event and who does not?
  - What are the responsibilities for each role?
  - What is the minimum and maximum number of members for the Development Team?
  - What factors should be taken into consideration when deciding on the length of a sprint?
  - What is the difference between the Scrum Team and the Development Team?
  - What is the goal of each Scrum event? How does this fit with the empirical process model of Scrum?
  - Who is allowed to add items to the backlog and make adjustments to them?
  - How should the backlog be prioritised?
  - Who is responsible for estimating the backlog?
- Read articles on the Product Owner role. There are more than enough on Medium. This helps understanding different perspectives and getting more in depth about what the role really entails. You will also be able to spot the mistakes people make in their articles. Scrum is easy to learn, but hard to master.

### Doing the PSPO I certification
The certification takes 60 minutes and consists of 80 questions. You will not have a lot of time to think things through. Be prepared for this so you do not feel pressured. I would categorise the exam as easy in terms of difficulty. If you followed all the steps above you should not worry. A lot of the questions you will immediately know the answer to without really having to think a lot. Some of the questions will be a bit tougher and just take the time to think them through. You can always mark the difficult questions and revisit them later.

### Notes
The PO role is to focus on the Value that the engine of the Development team delivers. To be really effective this needs to consider the Return on Investment (RoI) and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). This means that the PO will care deeply about having a well refined ordered backlog and clear understanding of and commitment to Done. This will then enable them to get product to customer with few or no impediments.

Some Questions-
1. How does the Sprint Backlog relate to the Product Backlog? 
Backlog Ownership 
The Product Owner owns the Product Backlog, and prioritizes it on behalf of the stakeholders. The Sprint Backlog is the property of the Team, and they are the sole arbiters of its contents. 
Contents of the Sprint Backlog 
The Sprint Backlog contains user stories popped off the top of the Product Backlog during Sprint Planning. However, the Sprint Backlog usually contains many things not on the Product Backlog, such as: 
Tasks that have been decomposed from the user stories accepted by the Team for the current iteration. 
Story points or time estimates for individual tasks. 
Refinements of the "definition of done" as it relates to a specific story or task. 
Refinements to stories that don't compromise the Sprint Goal or require the Product Owner to call for an early termination of the Sprint. 
In-sprint stories or tasks added by the Team to support the current Sprint Goal. 
The Sprint Goal and stories accepted for the current Sprint are set during Spring Planning, but tasks (and occasionally stories) on the Sprint Backlog are updated and modified by the Team in whatever way they see fit--it's the Team's artifact, and is theirs to manage in support of the Sprint Goal. 
Agile Means Change 
While the stories accepted into the Sprint Backlog during Sprint Planning are generally fixed, if the team finishes early, they are encouraged to pull additional work off the Product Backlog if they believe it can fit into the current Sprint without compromising the Sprint Goal. In addition, sometimes additional knowledge or information comes to light during the Sprint, and the Team and Product Owner can cooperatively remove stories from the Sprint if doing so helps the Team meet the current Sprint Goal. 
In addition, user stories are starting points for conversations with stakeholders (or the Product Owner if done by proxy), so adding and deleting tasks from the Sprint Backlog as stories are worked is quite common. Part of the art of Scrum is in differentiating between refinements that come from reducing the cone of uncertainty during a Sprint from changes to stories that jeopardize the Sprint Goal. 
No Invisible Work, Ever 
Generally, Sprint Backlog items should be decompositions of Product Backlog items, or supporting tasks that glue together stories in the current Sprint. Again, the art is in differentiating between tasks that the Team needs to create on the Sprint Backlog to support the Sprint Goal versus stories that need to be placed on the Product Backlog. 
As an example, if you have a story that requires you to seed a database, you may need to add a task to your Sprint Backlog to install a new database server. Usually, this task would be added during Sprint Planning, but the task may not become obvious until later in the Sprint. In such cases, it's perfectly acceptable to add the newly-discovered tasks to the Sprint Backlog as long as they don't compromise the Sprint Goal or invalidate the stories accepted into the Sprint. 
Team stories beyond that properly belong on the Product Backlog. For example, setting up a full-blown database architecture is a story that should be prioritized by the Product Owner as a prerequisite for other stories in the Product Backlog. These types of stories are generally added during Backlog Grooming, and occasionally during Sprint Planning; after that, they are treated like any other story in the Product Backlog. 
Don't Fear the Product Backlog 
[W]ould it be possible to add things like items from our Retrospective into Sprint backlog and avoid messing up Product backlog? 
It depends. If your Sprint Retrospective leads to process changes or in-sprint tasks for the Team, then of course those things should be added to one of the backlogs. Tasks and internal processes belong on the Sprint Backlog; sub-projects that consume time or resources outside of individual story estimates belong on the Product Backlog. 
Don't be afraid of "messing up the Product Backlog." The Product Backlog is not some inviolate, unchangeable document. A healthy Scrum process should encourage ongoing conversations between the Product Owner and the Team, and encourage adding infrastructure and tool-chain stories to the Product Backlog so that their costs and benefits are visible to the project and the organization.  
2. What tasks must the Product Owner be responsible for, and what can the Product Owner delegate to others? 
The PO is responsible for maximizing the product value and creating PBI. He can delegate the writing of PBI, but he remain accountable for it. 
3. How small should a ready Product Backlog item be? Why is it important for Product Backlog items to be clear? 
Small enough to be completed in one sprint. PBI must be clear, otherwise DT can't estimate how much work is needed to complete them. 
4. When determining the order a Product Backlog, what should the Product Owner consider? What don't they need to consider? 
PO should consider customer feedback, stockholders feedback, market value, risk reduction. PO should not consider DT techniques and tool. 
5. When are the Scrum Team and stakeholders required to meet? Can they meet outside this event? 
ST and stackeholders can meet only during sprint review and never outside this event. 
6. How does the Product Owner determine the value of a done increment? 
No idea. 
7. What can a Development Team do if theyâ€™re having trouble developing a piece of functionality? 
Renegotiate the scope with PO 
8. What are the feedback loops in Scrum? 
Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective 
9. What is the Sprint Backlog, and who owns it? When is it created and when is work added or removed? 
It is the work DT committed to and it is own by DT. Work can be added and removed anytime and it is created in the sprint planning.
