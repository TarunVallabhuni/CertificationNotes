### Azure for Data Engineer

**Data Abundance**  
For structured databases, data architects define the structure (schema) as they create the data storage in platform technologies such as Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse. For unstructured (NoSQL) databases, each data element can have its own schema at query time. Data can be stored as a file in Azure Blob storage or as NoSQL data in Azure Cosmos DB or Azure HDInsight.

**Difference between on-premises and cloud-based servers**  

On-Premise  vs Cloud-based   
> Computing environment (physical servers, network infrastructure and storage), Licensing, Maintenance, Scalability, Availability, Support, Multilingual support  

Ways to go from On-Premise to Cloud  
- Lift and shift vs migration 

**Job Responsibilities**  

From SQL server professional to Data Engineer  
ETL vs ELT  
You spend less time setting up services, and you focus more on security and on deriving business value from your data.

Understanding for later: Azure cosmos DB(multimaster replication model), Databricks(Big data and AI)
